Project Manager: Thanks everyone for joining. Let’s do a quick progress check on the SuperBank web app.

Frontend Developer: The dashboard UI is mostly complete. Account overview, transaction list, and basic navigation are working. We’re currently polishing the responsive design for mobile.

Backend Developer: The core APIs are done. User authentication, account data, and transaction endpoints are live. We’re now focusing on performance optimization and logging.

Full Stack Developer: Frontend and backend integration is going smoothly. Login and data fetching are working in the staging environment.

QA Engineer: Initial testing has started. No major bugs so far, just a few UI alignment issues and minor validation errors.

Project Manager: Great progress. Let’s aim to finish optimization and testing by the end of the week. Thanks everyone.
